## What is in the PDB database

The main repository of biomolecular strucutre info is the PDB <www.rcsb.org>. 

Let's see what this database contains:


```{r}
stats <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv", row.names =1)
stats
```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
#sum(stats$X.ray)
```
Values are characters instead of integers/numbers

```{r}
as.numeric(c(10,"1,000"))
```

We got to get rid of the commmas. Can you find a function to get rid of commas?

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
```

I am going to turn this into a function then use `apply()` to work on the entire table of data
```{r}
sumcomma <- function(x){
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
}

sumcomma(stats$X.ray)
```
```{r}
n.total <-sumcomma(stats$Total)
n.total
```

```{r}
sumcomma(stats$EM)
```


```{r}
apply(stats,2,sumcomma)/ sumcomma(stats$Total)
```

84.1 % are solved by X-ray and 9.2% are solved by EM.

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
189750/n.total
```
86.6% of the structures in the PDB are proteins

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

```{r}
186898 / 248805733 * 100
```

## Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

Mol* ("mol-star") viewer is now everywhere. The homepage is here: https://molstar.org/viewer/

I want to insert my image from Mol* here.

## Working with the bio3d package

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```


```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can do a bioinformatics prediction of functional motions (i.e. flexibility/dynamics)

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb
```

```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file= "adk_m7.pdb")
```

# Comparative Analysis of Protein Structures

Here we will work through a complete pipeline of analysis for a given protein family starting from one single database ID for a member of this family all the way to a deeper understanding of structure, dynamics, and function.


```{r}
library(bio3d)
```


```{r}
id <- "1AKE_A"

aa <- get.seq(id)
aa
```

```{r}
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
#Download related PDB files

files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)

```

```{r}
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

```{r}
pdbs
```

```{r}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
